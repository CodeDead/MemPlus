This project was created to mock all paid memory optimizers. MemPlus is an entirely free, completely functional 'memory optimizer' that will 'safely' free up non-essential memory in Windows.

# Requirements in order to build
* [Visual Studio](https://vistualstudio.com)
* [.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56116)
* [Syncfusion](https://syncfusion.com) ([Community edition available](https://www.syncfusion.com/products/communitylicense))

# Anything else?
Yes. Don't fall for these memory optimizers that will speed up your system by 100000% percent scams. This will actually free up your memory, but it will cost you dearly in performance and might cause system instability. Do not use these tools on any essential devices. And we, CodeDead, are not responsible for any damages that this type of software can cause to your system.
